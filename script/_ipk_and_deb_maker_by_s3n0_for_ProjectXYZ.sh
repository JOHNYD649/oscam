# sh script for Enigma2 - the IPK package creation tool
# 2018-2023, by s3n0
#
# Simple creation of an IPK package without the use of OPKG-TOOLS.
# It's just a simple archiving of files or folders and then merging the created files into one.
#
# A note:
#
# The version of the plugin is taken from the "version.txt" file, which must always be present
# in the same folder where the plugin is located. I also use it in the plugin's own algorithm.
#
# It is also important to edit the created "control" file below - in this script, according to the needs of your project / plugin !




#### specify the plugin folder, the plugin version, the package output path + package filename, etc. :

PLUGIN_NAME="Project XYZ"

PLUGIN_DIR="/usr/lib/enigma2/python/Plugins/Extensions/"`echo "${PLUGIN_NAME}" | tr -d " -"`    # PLUGIN_NAME: delete all " " and "-" characters
PLUGIN_LANG_DIR="${PLUGIN_DIR}/locale"

PROJECT_DIR="/tmp/${RANDOM}"
BUILD_DIR="/tmp/${RANDOM}"

VER=$(cat "$PLUGIN_DIR/version.txt")        # VER="1.0.0"
ARCH="all"                                  # chipset / CPU architecture dependency:  all, mips32el, mipsel, armv7ahf-neon, cortexa15hf-neon-vfpv4, aarch64, ...etc.

IPK_PCKGNAME="enigma2-plugin-extensions-"`echo "${PLUGIN_NAME,,}" | tr " " "-"`                 # PLUGIN_NAME: lower case, replace all spaces with "-"
IPK_FILENAME="${IPK_PCKGNAME}_${VER}_${ARCH}.ipk"
IPK_FINISHED="/tmp/${IPK_FILENAME}"

# the description of the plugin will be extracted from the file "plugin.py":
#PLUGIN_DESCRIPTION=$(awk '/def Plugins/,/\]\s\n/' $PLUGIN_DIR/plugin.py | grep -E 'description.*=' | sed -e 's/.*description\s\=\s["'\'']//' -e 's/["'\''].*//')
# Warning : most Enigma2 distributions usually compile the found "*.pyo" files into "*.py" format after a restart and thus the possibility of getting the description from the "plugin.py" file is also lost!
# if you don't want or don't use the plugin definition in the "plugin.py" file, you can use your own definition here, for example:
PLUGIN_DESCRIPTION="Plugin for the needs of the Project XYZ tests"




# ==== preinst ========= (before installing a package) =====
# This script executes before that package will be unpacked from its Debian archive (".deb/.ipk") file. 
# Many 'preinst' scripts stop services for packages which are being upgraded until their installation or
# upgrade is completed (following the successful execution of the 'postinst' script).
#
# ==== postinst ======== (after installing a package) ======
# This script typically completes any required configuration of the package foo once foo has been unpacked from its Debian archive (".deb/.ipk") file.
# Often, 'postinst' scripts ask the user for input, and/or warn the user that if he accepts default values, he should remember to go back and re-configure that package
# as the situation warrants. Many 'postinst' scripts then execute any commands necessary to start or restart a service once a new package has been installed or upgraded.
#
# ==== prerm =========== (before removing a package) =======
# This script typically stops any daemons which are associated with a package. It is executed before the removal of files associated with the package.
#
# ==== postrm ========== (after removing a package) ========
# This script typically modifies links or other files associated with foo, and/or removes files created by the package.
